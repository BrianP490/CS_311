Binary Search Program

1)	Declare a 4x4 matrix containg a vector of integers.  vector<int> Matrix[4][4];
2)	What does W(n) mean in general? (W? n? W(n)?) W() is the function, n is the size, W(n) is the worst case
3)	For sequential search:
a.	W(n) = n	
b.	When does it happen? It happens when the element being searched for is the last ellement checked.
4)	What does B(n) mean in general? (B?, n?, B(n)?) B(n) is the best and quickest possible outcome. n is the size, B() is the function
5)	For sequential search:
a.	B(n) =	1	
b.	When does it happen? It happens when the element searched for is in the first index.
6)	Why is A(n) difficult to determine for the real world problems? There is always a random probability in real world problems.
7)	Why donâ€™t we care about constants and lesser terms in a time complexity expression? They are insignificant compared to the growth rate of the function.
8)	Prove that 3n^2 + 4n = O(n^2) as I did in the notes. (must give C and the starting point for n)
First, we need a C where, Cn^2 >= 3n^2 + 4n
			(C-3)n^2  >= 4n
			(C-3)n >= 4;   	let C = 4
			(4-3)n >= 4
			n >= 4
Therefore, it is true for all n>=4 QED.
			
9)	Binary search corresponds to the shallow search tree.
Sequential search corresponds to a / the skewed tree.
Hint: think of the shape/height
10)	Thus, the fastest ordered list search does W(n)=Theta(log n) comparisons.
11)	But, the fastest unordered list search does W(n)=Theta(n) comparisons.
